<!-- BANNER -->

**Trains your attention and speed** by performing **automated actions if you take too long** to go through your reviews. Three different levels of 'encouragements' are provided:

- **automatically play an alert**
- **automatically reveal the answer**
- **automatically fail the card** 

All of these can be configured individually for each deck options group.

<!-- CHANGELOG -->

### USAGE

1. Open deck options
2. Navigate to the 'General' tab
3. Find the three new options as shown in the screenshot above and configure them to your liking

The alert and answer reveal timeout refer to seconds spent on the question side, while the auto-'again' timer starts counting after revealing the question.

Setting any of the timers to `0` will disable them.

### CONFIGURATION

You can customize the alert sound by replacing `alert.mp3` in the add-on folder with a sound file of your choice. Just make sure that it's named the same and sporting the same file format.
