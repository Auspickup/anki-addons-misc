All credit for the original add-ons goes to their respective authors.

### nest0r / ja-dark

The original versions of the following add-ons were likely written by nest0r/ja-dark who [disappeared from the Anki scene](https://forum.koohii.com/thread-14570.html) in early 2017:

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of the add-on authors above, both for their fantastic add-ons, and for what I have learned from studying their work.
